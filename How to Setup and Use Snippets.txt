1) Copy all files from Dropbox to desktop

2) Run DLTray.exe (You can run it from DropBox if you want, but make your own folder and add Dropbox to Favorites. If you run it from Daniel's DLTray-Published, his changes will overwrite your local changes.)

3) Right click system tray icon and choose "Edit Settings"

Codes from AutoIT
^ = Ctrl
# = Windows Key
! = Alt

4) Change initial hotkey from Ctrl-Enter if you want (I do)

5) After changes to DLTray.ini, close .ini file, exit DLTray and rerun .exe to make changes.

6) snippetToClipToggleHotkey toggles between Clipboard mode enabled/disabled

7) Right click systray to change language of Snippets (Normal text has most common commands)

8) Right clich systray icon and choose "Mangage Snippets" to create snippets

9) Choose the language you want it added to

10) Give it a name in the Tag Name: box

11) Add text you want to the Snippet Text: box

12) Click Add/Modify to save

13) To modify a snippet, choose it, make changes and click Add/Modify again

14) During the execution, the program can interpret a single line of AutoIt code

15) If you use more than one wildcard in a Snippet, it is hard to control the order of execution

16) When using Snippets, hit key command which opens the snippets window. Choose the snippet you want using the mouse wheel and click OR type the entire name of the snipper OR but NOT the scroll bar OR click "Select a Snippet" from the systray icon.


Encryption

Choose "Encryption" on the menu and enter your desired encryption key.  The key is encrypted and then stored in the local system's registry.  Be sure to make note of the encryption key because otherwise your wildcard snippets will be lost and unusable if DLtray is moved to another system.
