DLTray is an AutoIT script based tray utility that holds code snippets.  Many IDEs have code snippets built into them, but then those snippets are stuck in that IDE.

After being frustrated with constantly having to import and re-import snippets into whatever the next IDE was, I sat down to write my own utility.  

It uses primarily the clipboard and some sendkeys functionality built into windows to drop in the snippets. 

I started out by borrowing the UI elements from the Snippets module in Notepad++ (Which was my 'IDE' at the time).  

Version 3.0 is the first version I have felt comfortable sharing out to the world. 

The .au3 file is autoIT version 3.0.  You can learn more about autoIT at autoitscript.com.
